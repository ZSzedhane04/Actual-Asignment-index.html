  introducedto the world like fitness watches , they are one of the technologies<br>
  of the world that are going to only get smarter by reading more than just your <br>

  <li>Particular event or person ? </li>
  - My interest in IT started when I was laid off as a casual factory worker <br>
  during the lockdown , being jobless gave me perspective on what the world is shaping to be <br>
  Technologies like fitness watches became a piece of equipment that i was fond of and became <br>
  interested on how they worked because i had so much spare time , my interest turned into a <br>
  a desire .
  <li> Outline IT experience </li>
  - My IT experience is very short and bot very broad , i have never been the one <br>
  who knew a lot about technology . I said in the oreintation activities that my knowledge <br>
  does not go beyond turning something off and on if the device is not not working .

    -I expect to learn how technologies work and use that knowledge to get me qualified<br>
     for jobs that can make my future strong .<br>
     -I expect to learn what makes new technologies such an important aspect of life <br>
      and why change is good for life . what makes devices like the alexa and google home ,<br>
       so important to our life and why we are heading to a world that requires us to use our voice to get tasks done .
