<h1> Interest in IT </h1>
<ul>
  <li> What is your interest in IT ? </li>
  - The interest in IT is the ever expanding technologies that are being <br>
  introducedto the world like fitness watches , they are one of the technologies<br>
  of the world that are going to only get smarter by reading more than just your <br>
  steps and heartrate , they could potentially read your blood level and so on .
  <li>When did your interest in IT start ? </li>
  - Last year during the early stages of the lockdown in Sydney , nearing April
  <li>Particular event or person ? </li>
  - My interest in IT started when I was laid off as a casual factory worker <br>
  during the lockdown , being jobless gave me perspective on what the world is shaping to be <br>
  Technologies like fitness watches became a piece of equipment that i was fond of and became <br>
  interested on how they worked because i had so much spare time , my interest turned into a <br>
  a desire .
  <li> Outline IT experience </li>
  - My IT experience is very short and bot very broad , i have never been the one <br>
  who knew a lot about technology . I said in the oreintation activities that my knowledge <br>
  does not go beyond turning something off and on if the device is not not working .
  <li>Why RMIT </li>
  -	RMIT is a school that is a specialized school for students wanting to learn and broaden their knowledge of IT . <br>
    My knowledge of IT is not very large but hopefully I can use RMIT to make my knowledge useful and large .
    <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studeis </h3>
  <p>  -I expect to learn how technologies work and use that knowledge to get me qualified
     for jobs that can make my future strong .I expect to learn what makes new technologies such an important aspect of life <br>
      and why change is good for life . what makes devices like the alexa and google home ,
       so important to our life and why we are heading to a world that requires us to use our voice to get tasks done .</p>

<font size ='6'> Result of my Learning style Test </font> <br>
<p> -	Tactile learner :<br>
   “ Hands on learner “ . It shows that reading and doing theory work is not the must effective way of learning for me .<br>
    For me reading books are not the same as doing / experiencing the content that I am studying . <br>

<font size ='6'> Result of my Leadership Test </font> <br>
    <p> -<i>	Transformative leader</i> :  Transformative leadership style is very open to change and has a very open mind on achieving the end goal . <br>
      Transformative leaders are focused on the future of projects and strive for innovation that will help in success of the group . To me it shows that there is never one way to achieve a goal , <br>
       being ignorant to any idea and being stubborn towards change is a negative aspect in general and its something I do not stand for . <br>

<br>
<br>
<font size = '4'><u> How do these results influence behaviour in a team ?</u> </font><br>
<br>
<p> The tests do show that I am very determined in achieving the teams goal no matter what obstacle is in my way , <br>
  the results also show that I do prefer not to read and be very stagnant in my movement<br>
   which reults that i prefer creating and being very hands on when carrying out activities in a group project . <br>
 This has its up's and down's as members of groups rely on others to remember large and dense amounts of information ,<br>
  and if someone who prefers not to do these actions for the team , it can cause friction amoung the group . </p>
<br>
<br>
<font size = '4'><u> How should you take this into account when forming a team ?</u> </font><br>
<p> -	When forming a team I would look for people who look and think outside the box , people that having abstract perspectives usually have the most interesting ideas so having a balanced mixture of creative , hard working and practical members in team are key .
   The general mentality of the team would be in finishing the task at hand no matter how hard or challenging  . From the results shown from the tests i have done , I would be very acceptable to all ideas and having a well bonded group is vital to group success . </p>

<h1> Project Idea </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> -	My project idea is an app that will assist in finding and discovering local dining spots . The app would include locations to all chained and non-chained business that serve food in your designated search area assisting in finding the place to eat easily just by one search . This app would include in your search the reliable information needed to help in making your decision such as , customer ratings , prices , the location of business’s and menu’s of many restaurants . The information provided by the app will help customers make a clearer choice of where and what they will be eating at that time of the day making life just ever so simple and easy by taking the hassle out of finding the correct spot to eat . </p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p> -	The motivation behind this app is to stop the ever going argument “ where to eat “ , we have all been there where we either argue with ourselves or the people we are with about what to eat . This isn’t the biggest issue we face as a species but it is something many of us have experienced , but it is an issue because it is technically a decision making problem and the seriousness behind decision making is that we always have a deadline to make and the danger of deadline stated in the article by the Wall Street Journal “ The Inner Working of the Executive Brain “ suggest that deadlines create stress and tension while limiting our thinking . This is expressed when you add the factor of being hungry into the mixture and decisions become drastically harder to make , as you are struggling what to eat , how much you are willing to spend and how far the food is . </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p> -	The features of the app are mainly to serve as tools to help users find ; the most affordable spot to eat where that being either a local kebab shop or a local chicken shop or a fancy restaurant that has the most luxurious cuisine , the place with the best ratings which would identify particular restaurants that have treated there customers very well and are most likely to give the user the same experience , another feature would be being able to research a restaurants menu before making a decision on what you would be dining on from that place , finally directions and location details towards selected restaurants in your designated search area . Any additional features would be a list of restaurants that are currently on the “ Name and Shame “ government website of Food Authority , this would allow the user of the app to see what establishments have been recently cited with penalties due to food mishandling , the benefit of having a feature like this would allow user’s of the application to see reliable information about the restaurants that have lately not been meeting food safety procedures and assist in making decisions as they have relevant and reliable information on where to eat .
The main features of the app are the search bar , ratings , prices and menu . The search bar would work by entering either a suburb or post code and ALL eateries that include , restaurants , bars , fast food chains and local business’s that are in that area will show up
on a map of the location they have searched  and having permission from the user themselves the app would have the location of the user and show where their current location is to where the restaurants and other food businesses are located from the users position .
 The next feature of the app would be the application of user rating, the rating system would be implemented for users to rate the restaurant they previously experienced the businesses hospitality and rate the place on a numbered scale from 1-10. The higher the rating is the better the experience was and the lower the number is rated at, the poorer performance was displayed by the certain business on the particular time the user was present at that point of time . The rating system is to showcase the how good the establishment is at expressing its hospitality towards its customer , the user of the app would use this information from past customers to make a judgement of the business and make their own decision whether they will proceed to feast at the specific spot .
The prices and menu feature add to the decision making process as it adds the most important information, affordability and what the business has to offer . The price feature would include a filter that shows the pricing from $0 to any particular price that the user is willing the spend , this feature is key as the filter shows what foods are most affordable and from experience that usually takes the cake 😉. Seeing the menu is also a very vital feature to the apps function as the users will be able to see what the business is selling and showcase to the users of the app all of their product , and having all the options accessible to the user makes the decision very easy what to eat and whether the user is satisfised with the particular businesses product’s . </p>
<h2>Tools & Technologies </h2>
<p>-The app would be used in both Apple and Android devices .  One of the main software’s would be “personica “ the software that includes , analytics software and Price ,Menu Optimization and CRM . The software would take all the aspects of the digital restaurant into one software , the software is a all-in-one package as the software would be in charge of the crucial features of the app affordability and product . Esri ArcGIS would be the software used to help identify the searched business’s, as it is a comprehensive , it also provides data and geo-enrichment as a bonus to help with sum of necessary information .</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>-The skills required for an app like this would be found in people who are very developed and experienced in coding and software engineering . Building an app like this seems to be very difficult , especially for someone who has no experience with code , software or hardware tools like me , but have a team of people who have a good understanding or a basic background in coding and the use of software’s would find it as a feasible task. The issue with completing such a task like this app is the many platform the app consist of , the has very dense features such as the locating platform and the restaurant platform . These platforms would be heavy to build s there are so many business’s to include making an app like this a challenging job . </p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>-Upon success the outcome of this app would make decision making about food much easier for people using the app. The app would be used for all age types and would hopefully grow into a trend where by business would consider being exclusive to the app by promoting the app and their business , like how business now take great pride on how their restaurant is viewed by online critics and bloggers but the difference would be the business would promote their name by doing ad’s by expressing their reviews and where to find there establishment using the app . The goal of the app was to take the stress out of deciding where and what to eat as it shows the most affordable and its products in the one app, with the addition information the app provides it would make the decision making process much easier .</p>
