<h3> Interest in IT </h3>
<ul>
  <li> What is your interest in IT ? </li>
  - The interest in IT is the ever expanding technologies that are being <br>
  introducedto the world like fitness watches , they are one of the technologies<br>
  of the world that are going to only get smarter by reading more than just your <br>
  steps and heartrate , they could potentially read your blood level and so on .
  <li>When did your interest in IT start ? </li>
  - Last year during the early stages of the lockdown in Sydney , nearing April
  <li>Particular event or person ? </li>
  - My interest in IT started when I was laid off as a casual factory worker <br>
  during the lockdown , being jobless gave me perspective on what the world is shaping to be <br>
  Technologies like fitness watches became a piece of equipment that i was fond of and became <br>
  interested on how they worked because i had so much spare time , my interest turned into a <br>
  a desire .
  <li> Outline IT experience </li>
  - My IT experience is very short and bot very broad , i have never been the one <br>
  who knew a lot about technology . I said in the oreintation activities that my knowledge <br>
  does not go beyond turning something off and on if the device is not not working .
  <li>Why RMIT </li>
  -	RMIT is a school that is a specialized school for students wanting to learn and broaden their knowledge of IT .<br>
    My knowledge of IT is not very large but hopefully I can use RMIT to make my knowledge useful and large .
    <li>What do you expect to learn during your studeis </li>
    -I expect to learn how technologies work and use that knowledge to get me qualified<br>
     for jobs that can make my future strong .<br>
     -I expect to learn what makes new technologies such an important aspect of life <br>
      and why change is good for life . what makes devices like the alexa and google home ,<br>
       so important to our life and why we are heading to a world that requires us to use our voice to get tasks done .

<h1>Personal Profile </h1>

<font size='6' > Results of Myler-Briggs test </font> <br>
<p> -	Defender ISFJ-T : The test shows that my characteristics mean that getting the job done is the most important objective when performing a task .<br>
   The test also shows that my personality is very dedicated and very practical , which means to me that creating a project is something <br>
   someone with the personality type I have is comfortable with . I have always been a very practical person and actually doing an activity which is beneficial no matter what. <br> </p>

<font size ='6'> Result of my Learning style Test </font> <br>
<p> -	Tactile learner :<br>
   “ Hands on learner “ . It shows that reading and doing theory work is not the must effective way of learning for me .<br>
    For me reading books are not the same as doing / experiencing the content that I am studying . <br>

    <br>
    <br>
<font size ='6'> Result of my Leadership Test </font> <br>
    <p> -<i>	Transformative leader</i> :  Transformative leadership style is very open to change and has a very open mind on achieving the end goal . <br>
      Transformative leaders are focused on the future of projects and strive for innovation that will help in success of the group . To me it shows that there is never one way to achieve a goal , <br>
       being ignorant to any idea and being stubborn towards change is a negative aspect in general and its something I do not stand for . <br>

<br>
<br>
<font size = '4'> How do these results influence behaviour in a team ? </font><br>
<br>
<p> The tests do show that I am very determined in achieving the teams goal no matter what obstacle is in my way , <br>
  the results also show that I do prefer not to read and be very stagnant in my movement<br>
   which reults that i prefer creating and being very hands on when carrying out activities in a group project . <br>
 This has its up's and down's as members of groups rely on others to remember large and dense amounts of information ,<br>
  and if someone who prefers not to do these actions for the team , it can cause friction amoung the group . </p>
<br>
<br>
<font size = '4'> How should you take this into account when forming a team ? </font><br>
<p> -	When forming a team I would look for people who look and think outside the box , people that having abstract perspectives usually have the most interesting ideas so having a balanced mixture of creative , hard working and practical members in team are key .
   The general mentality of the team would be in finishing the task at hand no matter how hard or challenging  . From the results shown from the tests i have done , I would be very acceptable to all ideas and having a well bonded group is vital to group success . </p>
